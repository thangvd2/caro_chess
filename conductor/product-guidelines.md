## Tone & Voice
- **Primary Tone:** Energetic & Exciting.

## Visual Identity
- **Typography & Colors:** Use bold, striking typography and a vibrant, high-contrast color palette to create a visually stimulating environment.
- **Animations:** Implement dynamic animations for key actions like piece placement, winning combinations, and menu transitions to keep the interface feeling alive.

## Feedback & Notifications
- **Visual Feedback:** Use impactful effects such as particle explosions or screen shakes to reward winning moves and significant plays.
- **Audio Cues:** Employ enthusiastic and satisfying sound effects for game interactions (e.g., "crunchy" placement sounds, celebratory win fanfares).
- **Messaging:** Ensure game status updates are clear, direct, and exciting (e.g., "Your Turn!", "EPIC WIN!").

## User Interface (UI/UX)
- **Layout Strategy:** Adopt a **Mobile-First & Responsive** design philosophy. The core interface should be optimized for touch interactions and scale elegantly to larger desktop screens.
